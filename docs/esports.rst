eSports API
===========

The official API does not support eSports. There is an API used by lolesports.com, but it is not officially supported and may change at any time without warning. There is some unofficial documentation here, but it might not be accurate or up-to-date https://gist.github.com/levi/e7e5e808ac0119e154ce A good example can be found here: https://github.com/Canisback/LoLWorlds2018/blob/master/gatherGames.ipynb
