You Application
===============

You can apply for a personal or production app by clicking "Register Project" on the main dev portal `page <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`_.

Applications take ~ two weeks (10 business days, barring holidays) to process. Make sure it's verified (riot.txt). If it's been longer than two weeks and you didn't change your application during that time period, ask a Guru on Discord for help.

You can find your app ID by going to https://developer.riotgames.com/apps, selecting your project from the list on the left, and copying the number in the URL (https://developer.riotgames.com/app/YOURAPPIDISHERE/info).

Production App
..............

Register your project to apply for a Production API Key with access to the Standard APIs and/or Tournaments API. A Production API key requires a working prototype. Production API keys are not for testing purposes. You may submit an application in the planning stage of your project, but your application for a production key won't be approved until your project is ready for public consumption. Work in progress should be tested using your demo key.

Personal App
............

Register your project to apply for a Personal API Key without the verification process. This is only for the Standard API's, not Tournaments. Personal Keys require a detailed description ofthe project.
