Replay API
==========

The Replay API is a new game client API that allows developers to adjust the in-game camera during replays. We have also released `League Director <https://github.com/riotgames/leaguedirector>`_, which uses these APIs and will give a good jumping off point for any development.

Because the Replay API is fairly new, the best place to start are the doc pages from Riot about the `Replay API <https://developer.riotgames.com/replay-apis.html>`_ and `League Director <https://github.com/riotgames/leaguedirector>`_.
